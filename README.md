# Arduino Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects and sketches that demonstrate various embedded systems and hardware control techniques using the Arduino platform. The projects range from basic LED control to more complex systems involving sensors, actuators, and communication modules. It serves as a resource for those interested in learning Arduino or building practical IoT and automation solutions.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the Arduino sketch files (`.ino`) for each project.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and project descriptions, explaining the purpose, hardware setup, and code details for each project.
- **`hardware/`**: Contains schematics and wiring diagrams for the hardware setup used in the projects.

## Key Projects

- **LED Control**: Basic LED blinking and fading control using Arduino pins.
- **Sensor Integration**: Interfacing with sensors like temperature, humidity, and light sensors to gather data and perform actions.
- **Motor Control**: Controlling DC and stepper motors using motor drivers and PWM signals.
- **IoT Applications**: Projects integrating Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules to create Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to upload the code to your Arduino board.
- **Arduino Board**: Any Arduino-compatible board such as Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano.

### Uploading the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-projects.git
   cd arduino-projects/src
   ```
2. Open the desired `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino board and select the appropriate board and port in the IDE.
4. Click the upload button to upload the sketch to your board.

## Hardware Setup

Each project folder contains a `README.md` file and hardware schematics explaining the wiring and components required to replicate the project. Diagrams are available in the `hardware/` directory.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have new projects, improvements, or ideas, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
